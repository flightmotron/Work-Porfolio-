Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![Project 1: ELK Stack] (Images/ELK Stack Diagram.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the YAML file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly stable, in addition to restricting access to the network.

    The off-loading function of the load balancer defends against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The JumBox prevents unwanted exposer of the network to the public

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the Jumpbox Provisoner and system network.

    Filebeat monitors the Apache server and MySQL database logs generated by DVWA
    Metricbeat collects specified metrics and statistics in the resource group

The configuration details of each machine may be found below. Note: Use the Markdown Table Generator to add/remove values from the table.
Name 	Function 	IP Address 	Operating System
Jump Box 	Gateway 	10.0.0.09 / 52.175.226.211 	Linux
Web 1 	  Configure 	10.0.0.10 	Linux
Web 2 	Load Balance 	10.0.0.11 	Linux
Web 3 	Load Balance 	10.0.0.12 	Linux
ElkServerHost 	Mon. / Log. 	10.1.0.4 / 52.251.56.102 	Linux
Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet.

Only the Jumpbox machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:

    205.197.212.210

Machines within the network can only be accessed by ssh.

    10.0.0.09

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.
Name 	Publicly Accessible 	Allowed IP Addresses
Jump Box 	Yes 	205.197.212.210
Web 1 	No 	10.0.0.09
Web 2 	No 	10.0.0.09
Web 3 	No 	10.0.0.09
ElkServerHost 	Yes 	10.0.0.9 /205.197.212.210
Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...

    being an open source automation platform, it increases productivity and standardizes deployments

The playbook implements the following tasks:

    Make sure docker is installed
    Pull Elk Image from the elk regisitry via a shell prompt
    Run the container that starts the ELK stack

The following screenshot displays the result of running docker ps after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

Target Machines & Beats

This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

  | 10.0.0.10 | 10.0.0.11 | 10.0.0.12

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:

    Filebeat; Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

    _Filebeat monitors the Apache server and MySQL database logs generated by DVWA
    Metricbeat collects specified metrics and statistics in the resource group like servers "uptime"

Using the Playbook

In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned:

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:

    Copy the playbook to the Ansible Control Nodule.
    Update the host file to include websever and elk.
    Run the playbook, and navigate to the Kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:

    _install-elk.yml | ElkServerHost VM
    _hosts.yml | Groups: When you run playbooks with Ansible, you specify which group to run them on. This allows you to run certain playbooks on some machines, but not on others. _
    _http://52.251.56.102:5601/app/kiban

As a Bonus, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc.
